# KmerResearch
Kmer Research in Python and R


The only libraries needed so far is Biostrings. You can install from RStudio or from https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R

We began by creating a kmer table with our DNA data (kmer size 4). Then moved to ML models as seen in the "models" folder. Each model, once sufficiently trained, will be saved in that folder. This will ensure we will not need to spend the time to train once again.
